config CACHE_FLUSH_WATCHDOG_THRESHOLD
	int "Bytes to flush between schedule() calls"
	default 4096
	help
	  The flush_cache() function periodically, and by default for
	  every 4k block, calls schedule() to reset watchdog. When
	  flushing a large area, that may add a significant amount of
	  overhead. This option allows you to set a threshold for how
	  many bytes to flush between each schedule() call.
