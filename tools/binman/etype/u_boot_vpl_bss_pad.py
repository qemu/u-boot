    This holds the padding added after the VPL binary to cover the BSS (Block
    Started by Symbol) region. This region holds the various variables used by
    VPL. It is set to 0 by VPL when it starts up. If you want to append data to
    the VPL image (such as a device tree file), you must pad out the BSS region
    to avoid the data overlapping with U-Boot variables. This entry is useful in
    that case. It automatically pads out the entry size to cover both the code,
    data and BSS.

    The contents of this entry will a certain number of zero bytes, determined
    by __bss_size

    The ELF file 'vpl/u-boot-vpl' must also be available for this to work, since
    binman uses that to look up the BSS address.
