Verified Boot for Embedded (VBE)
================================

Introduction
------------

VBE provides a standard boot mechanism for embedded systems. If defines
how firmware and Operating Systems are located, updated and verified.

Within U-Boot, one or more VBE bootmeths implement the boot logic. For example,
the vbe-simple bootmeth handles finding the firmware (e.g. in MMC) and starting
it. Typically the bootmeth is started up in VPL and controls which SPL and
U-Boot binaries are loaded.

A 'vbe' command provides access to various aspects of VBE's operation, including
listing methods and getting the status for a method.

For a detailed overview of VBE, see vbe-intro_. A fuller description of
bootflows is at vbe-bootflows_ and the firmware-update mechanism is described at
vbe-fwupdate_.
