Texas Instruments, TPS80031/TPS80032 PMIC

This device uses two drivers:
- drivers/power/pmic/tps80031.c (for parent device)
- drivers/power/regulator/tps80031_regulator.c (for child regulators)

This chapter describes the binding info for the PMIC driver and regulators.

Required properties for PMIC:
- compatible: "ti,tps80031" or "ti,tps80032"
- reg: 0x48

With those two properties, the pmic device can be used for read/write only.
To bind each regulator, the optional regulators subnode should exists.

Optional subnode:
- name: regulators (subnode list of each device's regulator)

Regulators subnode contains set on supported regulators.

Required properties:
- regulator-name: used for regulator uclass platform data '.name',

List of supported regulator nodes names for tps80031/tps80032:
- smps1, smps2, smps3, smps4, smps5
- ldo1, ldo2, ldo3, ldo4, ldo5, ldo6, ldo7, ldoln, ldousb

SMPS5 in Linux 3.1.10 is referred as vio, but datasheet clearly names it SMPS5.

Optional:
- regulator-min-microvolt: minimum allowed Voltage to set
- regulator-max-microvolt: minimum allowed Voltage to set
- regulator-always-on: regulator should be never disabled
- regulator-boot-on: regulator should be enabled by the bootloader

Example:

tps80032@48 {
	compatible = "ti,tps80032";
	reg = <0x48>;

	regulators {
		smps1 {
			regulator-name = "vdd_cpu";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <800000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1250000>;
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-boot-on;
		};

		...

		smps5 {
			regulator-name = "vdd_1v8_gen";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1800000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1800000>;
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-boot-on;
		};

		ldo1 {
			regulator-name = "avdd_dsi_csi";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1200000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;
			regulator-boot-on;
		};

		...

		ldousb {
			regulator-name = "avdd_usb";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <3300000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
		};
	};
};
