Texas Instruments, TPS65911 PMIC

This device uses two drivers:
- drivers/power/pmic/tps65910.c (for parent device)
- drivers/power/regulator/tps65911_regulator.c (for child regulators)

This chapter describes the binding info for the PMIC driver and regulators.

Required properties for PMIC:
- compatible: "ti,tps65911"
- reg: 0x2d

With those two properties, the pmic device can be used for read/write only.
To bind each regulator, the optional regulators subnode should exists.

Optional subnode:
- name: regulators (subnode list of each device's regulator)

Regulators subnode contains set on supported regulators.

Required properties:
- regulator-name: used for regulator uclass platform data '.name',

List of supported regulator nodes names for tps65911:
- vdd1, vdd2, vddctrl, vddio
- ldo1, ldo2, ldo3, ldo4, ldo5, ldo6, ldo7, ldo8

vddio in datasheet is referred as vio, but for reduction of code and
unification of smps regulators it is named vddio.

Optional:
- regulator-min-microvolt: minimum allowed Voltage to set
- regulator-max-microvolt: minimum allowed Voltage to set
- regulator-always-on: regulator should be never disabled
- regulator-boot-on: regulator should be enabled by the bootloader

Example:

tps65911@2d {
	compatible = "ti,tps65911";
	reg = <0x2d>;

	regulators {
		vdd1 {
			regulator-name = "vdd_1v2_backlight";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1200000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-boot-on;
		};

		...

		vddio {
			regulator-name = "vdd_1v8_gen";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1800000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1800000>;
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-boot-on;
		};

		ldo1 {
			regulator-name = "vdd_emmc_core";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <3300000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-boot-on;
		};

		...

		ldo8 {
			regulator-name = "vdd_ddr_hs";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1000000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1000000>;
		};
	};
};
