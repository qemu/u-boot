MAXIM, MAX77663 PMIC

This device uses two drivers:
- drivers/power/pmic/max77663.c (for parent device)
- drivers/power/regulator/max77663_regulator.c (for child regulators)

This chapter describes the binding info for the PMIC driver and regulators.

Required properties for PMIC:
- compatible: "maxim,max77663"
- reg: usually 0x1c or 0x3c

With those two properties, the pmic device can be used for read/write only.
To bind each regulator, the optional regulators subnode should exists.

Optional subnode:
- name: regulators (subnode list of each device's regulator)

Regulators subnode contains set on supported regulators.

Required properties:
- regulator-name: used for regulator uclass platform data '.name',

List of supported regulator nodes names for max77663:
- sd0, sd1, sd2, sd3, ldo0, ldo1, ldo2, ldo3, ldo4, ldo5, ldo6, ldo7, ldo8

Optional:
- regulator-min-microvolt: minimum allowed Voltage to set
- regulator-max-microvolt: minimum allowed Voltage to set
- regulator-always-on: regulator should be never disabled
- regulator-boot-on: regulator should be enabled by the bootloader

Linux driver binding for this driver is compatible.

Example:

max77663@1c {
	compatible = "maxim,max77663";
	reg = <0x1c>;

	regulators {
		sd0 {
			regulator-name = "vdd_cpu";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <800000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1250000>;
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-boot-on;
		};

		...

		ldo0 {
			regulator-name = "avdd_pll";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1200000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;
		};

		...

		ldo2 {
			regulator-name = "avdd_usb";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <3300000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-boot-on;
		};

		ldo3 {
			regulator-name = "vdd_sdmmc3";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <3000000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3000000>;
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-boot-on;
		};

		...

		ldo8 {
			regulator-name = "avdd_dsi_csi";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1200000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;
		};
	};
};
