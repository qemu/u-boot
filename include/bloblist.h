/*
 * This provides a standard way of passing information between boot phases
 * (TPL -> SPL -> U-Boot proper.)
 *
 * It consists of a list of blobs of data, tagged with their owner / contents.
 * The list resides in memory and can be updated by SPL, U-Boot, etc.
 *
 * Design goals for bloblist:
 *
 * 1. Small and efficient structure. This avoids UUIDs or 16-byte name fields,
 * since a 32-bit tag provides enough space for all the tags we will even need.
 * If UUIDs are desired, they can be added inside a particular blob.
 *
 * 2. Avoids use of pointers, so the structure can be relocated in memory. The
 * data in each blob is inline, rather than using pointers.
 *
 * 3. Bloblist is designed to start small in TPL or SPL, when only a few things
 * are needed, like the memory size or whether console output should be enabled.
 * Then it can grow in U-Boot proper, e.g. to include space for ACPI tables.
 *
 * 4. The bloblist structure is simple enough that it can be implemented in a
 * small amount of C code. The API does not require use of strings or UUIDs,
 * which would add to code size. For Thumb-2 the code size needed in SPL is
 * approximately 940 bytes (e.g. for chromebook_bob).
 *
 * 5. Bloblist uses 16-byte alignment internally and is designed to start on a
 * 16-byte boundary. Its headers are multiples of 16 bytes. This makes it easier
 * to deal with data structures which need this level of alignment, such as ACPI
 * tables. For use in SPL and TPL the alignment can be relaxed, since it can be
 * relocated to an aligned address in U-Boot proper.
 *
 * 6. Bloblist is designed to be passed to Linux as reserved memory. While linux
 * doesn't understand the bloblist header, it can be passed the indivdual blobs.
 * For example, ACPI tables can reside in a blob and the address of those is
 * passed to Linux, without Linux ever being away of the existence of a
 * bloblist. Having all the blobs contiguous in memory simplifies the
 * reserved-memory space.
 *
 * 7. Bloblist tags are defined in the enum below. There is an area for
 * project-specific stuff (e.g. U-Boot, TF-A) and vendor-specific stuff, e.g.
 * something used only on a particular SoC. There is also a private area for
 * temporary, local use.
 *
 * 8. Bloblist includes a simple checksum, so that each boot phase can update
 * this and allow the next phase to check that all is well. While the bloblist
 * is small, this is quite cheap to calculate. When it grows (e.g. in U-Boot\
 * proper), the CPU is likely running faster, so it is not prohibitive. Having
 * said that, U-Boot is often the last phase that uses bloblist, so calculating
 * the checksum there may not be necessary.
 *
 * 9. It would be possible to extend bloblist to support a non-contiguous
 * structure, e.g. by creating a blob type that points to the next bloblist.
 * This does not seem necessary for now. It adds complexity and code. We can
 * always just copy it.
 *
 * 10. Bloblist is designed for simple structures, those that can be defined by
 * a single C struct. More complex structures should be passed in a device tree.
 * There are some exceptions, chiefly the various binary structures that Intel
 * is fond of creating. But device tree provides a dictionary-type format which
 * is fairly efficient (for use in U-Boot proper and Linux at least), along with
 * a schema and a good set of tools. New formats should be designed around
 * device tree rather than creating new binary formats, unless they are needed
 * early in boot (where libfdt's 3KB of overhead is too large) and are trival
 * enough to be described by a C struct.
