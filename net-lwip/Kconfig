	  Include networking support based on the lwIP (lightweight IP)
	  TCP/IP stack (https://nongnu.org/lwip). This is a replacement for
	  the default U-Boot network stack and applications located in net/
	  and enabled via CONFIG_NET as well as other pieces of code that
	  depend on CONFIG_NET (such as cmd/net.c enabled via CONFIG_CMD_NET).
	  Therefore the two symbols CONFIG_NET and CONFIG_NET_LWIP are mutually
	  exclusive.
